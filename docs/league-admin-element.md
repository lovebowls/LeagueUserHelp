# League Admin Element User Guide

This guide explains how to use the League Admin Element to manage and configure your league.

## Overview

The League Admin Element is your central hub for creating, managing, and editing leagues. The interface is divided into two main sections:

*   **Left Panel**: A list of all the leagues you have access to.
*   **Right Panel**: Once you select a league, this panel shows detailed information and management options for that league, including a dashboard, team list, schedule, and more.

## Managing Leagues

The list on the left side of the screen shows all of your leagues.

### Creating a New League

*   Click the **"New League"** button at the top of the league list to open the league editor.
*   Here, you can define the league's name, the number of teams, and various rules like points for a win/draw, promotion/relegation spots, etc.

### Editing a League

*   Next to each league in the list, you'll find an **"Edit"** button (pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è).
*   Clicking this will open the same league editor, allowing you to change the league's settings.

### Copying a League

*   The **"Copy"** button (copy icon üìã) next to each league creates a duplicate of that league. This is useful for starting a new season with the same teams and rules.

### Deleting a League

*   The **"Delete"** button (trash can icon üóëÔ∏è) will permanently remove a league. You will be asked to confirm this action.

## Managing a Selected League

When you select a league from the list, the right-hand panel becomes active, showing you several tabs and panels for managing that specific league.

### Dashboard Tab

This is the main overview for the selected league. It provides at-a-glance information about recent activity and key statistics.

### Teams Panel

This panel lists all the teams currently in the league.

*   **Adding a Team**: Click the **"Add Team"** button to open a dialog where you can enter the new team's name.
*   **Editing a Team**: Click the **"Edit"** button next to a team to change its name.
*   **Removing a Team**: Click the **"Remove"** button to take a team out of the league. This is only possible if the team has not yet played any matches.

### Schedule Panel

This panel shows all the matches for the league, similar to the public-facing Schedule View.

*   **Adding a Match**: Click the **"Add Match"** button to manually create a new fixture between two teams.
*   **Editing a Match**: Click on any match in the list to open the match editor, where you can enter or change the score, date, and other details.
*   **Auto-Generating a Schedule**: If your league has teams but no matches, you may see a button to automatically generate a full home-and-away schedule for the season.

### Attention Panel

This panel is a helpful to-do list, showing you any matches that need administrative action. This typically includes:

*   Matches that have been played (their date is in the past) but a score has not yet been entered.
*   Fixtures that have potential scheduling conflicts (e.g., a team scheduled to play twice on the same day).

Clicking on any item in this list will take you directly to the relevant match editor.
